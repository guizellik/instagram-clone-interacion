4. This project uses a json-server as a fake API, therefore executing it will be also required to consume the data. Issue the following command: 'npm install -g json-server'

5. Once json-server is installed, it will be required to indicate which is the file to run, included changing the port otherwise it will use the default port (the same as react)
5.1. 'json-server --watch api.json --port 8000' (port number can be replaced for any other number you want, except 3000)
Tip: it is recommended to use 3000+ port number since the lower numbers can be used by your system
